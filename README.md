## Micro-Manager 

Micro-Manager is an application to control microscope hardware, such as cameras, xy-stages, filter wheels, etc..  It includes a hardware abstraction layer written in C++ and a user interface written in Java (Swing).  User and developer documentation can be found at https://micro-manager.org.

#### Branches 
The "master" branch of the [micro-manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager) respository is used to build version 2.0-gamma (binaries can be download from [micro-manager.org](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Download%20Micro-Manager_Latest%20Release)). The branch "svn-mirror" tracks the subversion repository at https://valelab4.ucsf.edu/svn/micromanager2/trunk/ that contains the source code for Micro-Manager 1.4.  

This repository uses submodules.  MMCore, MMDevice, and DeviceAdapters are now part of the [mmCoreAndDevices](https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices) submodule.  

#### Getting the source code
To get the complete source code follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager.git`
2. Move Git bash into the repository: `cd micro-manager`
3. Make sure any submodules are also cloned: `git submodule update --init --recursive`  
For more information about working with Git submodules click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).  
(Previously we recommended using the `--remote` flag when updating the submodule(s). This is no longer necessary and should be avoided.)

**Maintainers only**: Some vendors do not allow us to make public device adapters written for their equipment.  If you are part of the micro-manager group, you can get access to these "secret" device adapters by:

1. Move Git bash into the `mmCoreAndDevices` submodule: `cd mmCoreAndDevices`
2. Change to the "privateMain" branch: `git checkout privateMain`
3. "privateMain" has a submodule that main does not. Make sure that any new submodules are in a consistent state: `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`
